# satellite-dao
With objects becoming more intelligent and the adoption of decentralized infrastructure, we envision a future where we live in constant exchange with autonomous software-based agents. 
As such, the Satellite DAO showcases the potential of self-organisation, autonomous entities, distributed ownership and migration; it fosters an open discourse and much needed research in this area. 
The Satellite DAO administers the treasury and distributes missions to the community, thereby enabling the Satellite to travel the world. It wants to visit the marvels of earth, connect with humans and find herself, before she is sent to outer space. 

## Invite the Satellite to your exhibition
Do you think we need to do more research in the area of autonomous software-based agents? Do you like to discuss the topic and publish your findings?
Are you holding a conference about software-based agents, DAOs or smart mobility and are still in need of content?
Are you organizing a vernissage of digital art work and would like to display the Satellite? 
Now is the time to suggest Satelliteâ€™s next stop: join our Discord to leave a suggestion. 

## Guild of transporters
The guild of transporters is a very honorable organization. Only a few selected knights get the honor to transport the Satellite. The guild of transporters do control the Satellite Multi-Sig and will spend the funds in line with the Satellite DAOs Community.

### Code of Conduct for transporters
The transporter makes sure she uses climate friendly modes of transport and arrives punctual at the suggested stops. 
The transporter can choose freely from all the suggestions in the suggestion channel. 
The transporter coordinates with the inviting person, such that the timing works for both sides.
Once the transporter arrives, she can mint and collect her special NFT by using the current nonce displayed on the satellite.
The transporter pledges to collect memories from the trip as a tweet (280 Characters and at least one photo).

## Refrerences
The satellites older brother no1s1 is already fullfilling its purpose as provider for space.
